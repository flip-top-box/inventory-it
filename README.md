# IT Inventory & Asset Management

This application manages IT assets and general inventory by integrating these two critical operations into a single platform. 
By merging asset management with inventory tracking, this solution offers a comprehensive overview of the companyâ€™s resources, enhancing efficiency and ensuring operational flow.

##The application tackles the following issues that can be faced in IT inventory:
*Fragmented Management Systems - Separate systems for tracking IT assets and general inventory lead to inefficiencies and inaccuracies in record keeping.
*Reactive Inventory Replenishment - This method of inventory management reacts to stock shortages rather than preventing them. This reactive approach can disrupt operations and lead to unnecessary downtime.
*Inefficient Resource Utilization and Reporting - Without comprehensive insights into asset utilization and inventory levels, the company can neither optimize its use of resources nor accurately forecast future needs.
